# invaders
A command line Space Invaders game to practice Rust fundamentals.

## Prerequisits:
- Rust v1.50+

To install Rust on Linux or MacOS, from the command line run:  

	curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
	
## Run the Game:
In the root directory, run:

	cargo run
	
The first time this runs it will take a minute to compile, but subsequent games will run much faster. After it's done compiling, the game will then begin in a new terminal window.

## Playing the game
The controls are pretty simple:
- Arrow keys to move
- Space bar to shoot
- "q" or "esc" to quit the game early
